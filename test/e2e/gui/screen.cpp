    As a developer
    I want to create regular windows, tool panels, menus, and tooltips
        as child widgets of the root Screen widget
    So that all UI elements are part of a unified hierarchy
        and can be managed consistently

/*
Scenario: Adding a window to the screen
  Given I have empty screen 800x600 units
  When I create window with id="main", title="Main editor", leftTop={10, 20}, size={100, 80}
  Then the screen contains exactly one window with id="main"
    And window ["main"] has title="Main editor", leftTop={10, 20}, size={100, 80}
    And system window of ["main"] has title="Main editor", leftTop={10, 20}, size={100, 80}
*/

/*
Scenario: Adding a tool panel to the Screen
  Given I have created a Screen
    And I have created a tool panel titled "Toolbar"
  When I add the tool panel to the Screen
  Then the Screen should contain exactly one window
    And that window should be titled "Toolbar"
    And it should be marked as a tool panel
*/

/*
Scenario: Adding a menu as a child of Screen
  Given I have created a Screen
    And I have created a context menu titled "File Menu"
  When I add the menu to the Screen
  Then the Screen should contain exactly one popup element
    And it should be positioned relative to its target widget
*/

/*
Scenario: Adding a tooltip to the Screen
  Given I have created a Screen
    And I have created a tooltip with text "Save document"
  When I add the tooltip to the Screen
  Then the tooltip should appear at the specified position
    And it should disappear after a timeout or user interaction
*/

/*
Scenario: Managing Z-order of windows in the Screen
  Given I have created a Screen with two windows: "Main" and "Settings"
    And "Main" is currently active
  When I bring "Settings" to the front
  Then "Settings" should appear above "Main"
    And receive input events first
*/

/*
Scenario: All windows use the same coordinate system
  Given I have created a Screen with size 800x600
    And I have created a window positioned at (100, 100) with size 200x100
    And I have created a tooltip positioned at (150, 150)
  When I check their positions
  Then all widgets should report their coordinates relative to the Screen
*/

/*
Scenario: Rendering all windows in one pass
  Given I have created a Screen with multiple windows and tooltips
  When I call render on the Screen
  Then all visible windows should be rendered
    And all tooltips should be rendered in correct order
*/

/*
Scenario: Saving and restoring all windows from JSON
  Given I have created a Screen with several windows and panels
  When I serialize the Screen hierarchy to JSON
    And deserialize it back
  Then the restored Screen should have the same number and type of windows
    And each window should retain its original title and position
