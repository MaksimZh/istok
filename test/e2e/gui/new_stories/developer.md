As a developer
I want any subtree of the widget hierarchy to be encapsulated into a Page Object
So that I can write maintainable and reusable UI tests

As a developer
I want to create menus and tooltips with precise screen or widget-relative coordinates
So that they appear in the correct position relative to their target elements

As a developer
I want the library to include a FlexBox widget for grouping and laying out elements
So that I can create responsive and adaptive UIs without manual positioning

As a developer
I want to start the main event loop and rendering with a single command
So that I can focus on building the UI without boilerplate setup code

As a developer
I want to manually send messages to the GUI and explicitly trigger rendering
So that I can test, simulate, or integrate the UI into custom execution loops

As a developer
I want widgets to support different visual states (normal, hovered, pressed, disabled)
So that I can create visually responsive UI controls

As a developer
I want to apply themes and styles to the GUI
So that the application can switch between light/dark modes or brand-specific designs

As a developer
I want to programmatically simulate user input (mouse, keyboard)
So that I can test GUI behavior without real input devices

As a developer
I want to save and restore the full GUI state (positions, open windows, selected options)
So that users donâ€™t lose their work after restart
